    <p><i>“A person can never walk on the same street twice. People recreate their city every time they experience it”-Nick Tyler, Neuroscience for cities</i></p>

<p>Through the last few years, we have collected big data from every imaginable digital field. Data-driven design can be defined as a decision-making approach to the design process that heavily relies on collecting data about people’s behavior and attitude.</p>

<p>In order to measure how people experience urban space and as a consequence how they behave inside of it,  we need to understand the way they think, and how their brain functions. This is where neuroscience can help with the making of cities: understanding how people from a wide variety of perspectives can create their individual-yet-collective life in cities. With neuroscience we can discover how to help people respond to their sensorial perceptions so that this ecosystem can really work for them.</p>

<p>One important aspect of our life in the cities is User Experience. User Experience is how a user interacts with and experiences a space. It includes a person’s perceptions of utility, ease of use, and efficiency. User experience is subjective but the attributes that make it up are objective. We can learn more about user experience by exploring the way we perceive our environments.</p>

<p>Humans create cities based on their activities, while the city facilitates and limits our activities and behaviors. According to researchers from different scientific fields, buildings and cities have an impact upon the people – from physical to mental health, cognitive development and wellbeing to their levels of productivity.</p>

<p>Neuroscience and neurotechnology can offer us new ways to explore this impact, by helping urban professionals to create places that promote urban health and wellbeing, while mitigating the negative impacts of the city environment as far as possible.</p>

<p>In addition to this, new emerging digital technologies are offering us tools to work on bigger datasets. And for the first time in history many professionals from distinguishable disciplines are collaborating with the same objectives, working on new tools and new methodologies.</p>

<p><i>“With Neuroscience we can have a data-driven and data centered approach in design because what you are measuring is human data. However, we may have to come up with a new term (ss. Rather than Human-Centered) to describe a process where we capture data and people and the system makes decisions. We need to have a new, human-system-oriented, data-driven and common decision framework; a new archipelago”</i></p>

<!-- Every project has a beautiful feature shocase page. It's easy to include images, in a flexible 3-column grid format. Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so: 

	---
	layout: post
	title: Project
	description: a project with a background image
	img: /img/12.jpg
	---


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div>
<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="/img/5.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	This image can also have a caption. It's like magic. 
</div>

You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


<br/><br/><br/>


The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div> -->
